Data Acquisition and Processing 

For the Lindsay Transit 

From Lindsay Transit website created the csv file for the schedules of each route since the data was not available elsewhere 
Added the data into the ArcGIS pro and joined to the feature class with routes and stops
The name of the stops in the available feature layer was different form the bus stops from the Lindsay Transit website 
Repeated the join for another data set which is available in the hub but is not current 2020.
Most of the bus stops name are matched except for the updated ones since 2020.  
This data set also does not have Orange Route at all.
For the Orange stops name were matched with the updated dataset 
Exported orange route from this data set. 
Added the csv file for the schedule of each route as well as the bus stop feature into AGOL
While adding the CSV file the option of both csv and Table (hosted) were selected so that the table can be used in other Esri suites as well. 


# Dashboard 
For the general UI/UX idea first dashboard was created
The maps with all the routes, and stops layer was created in AGOL
In the create dashboard Lindsay Transit dashboard was created 
Then the following map was added to the dashboard
