# Routing Esri SDK
Reference 
https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/sandbox/?sample=route
While using this developers documentation as reference I tried routing for the Lindsay Transit
With only the code available I am not able to even load the map

Using the layers from content of AGOL
https://sharmilaw.github.io/Routing/RoutingSDK.html

The layers was displayed but the code did not run when the route, graphics functions were defined and used
I have tried several times but still not able to make the routing sucessfully.
