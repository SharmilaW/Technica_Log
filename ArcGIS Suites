### Review 
This can be no code solution for web. 
The item like web map and dashboard can be just dragged and dropped while only using UI/UX.  
Can be designed for desktop, tablet and mobile phones at the same platform.  

### Budget
Experience Builder is included with the Creator and GIS Professional user types 

It will always remain in the arcgis domain and cannot be customized into other domain. 
(For our collab clients want it in their domain, but it cannot be customized)
It also cannot be moved from one account to another. ( If we create it using our student account it cannot be directly transferred to the clients account)
