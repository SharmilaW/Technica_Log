The demo was created without making any changes
The following errors was found

For Lindsay Transit, following changes were made
Since the basemap was not loading the base map was changed

Still there are some errors but this is the final product.

Still I am not able to add the feature layers 
(might try with the geojson file) 
And the routing is also not working
